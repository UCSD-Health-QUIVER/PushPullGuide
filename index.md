### Note:
This guide assumes you have already set up Git and the Git extension in Visual Studio. If you haven't, and want to know how, [click here](https://ucsd-health-rmas.github.io/StartupGuide/) to go to the startup guide.

# Creating a New Repository
Repositories are a lot like file folders in a shared drive. To create a new repository in the organiztion's shared Github, follwo these instructions! First, in Visual Studio, click on the "Git" option in the top left, and select "create Git repository" from the dropdown.

You should now see a screen like this!

If you haven't already logged in to you Github account through Visual Studio, click the login button to open a pop-up window. Enter your username and password to link your Visual Studio to your Github account and allow Viaul Studio to push and pull files from Github. Once you've logged in, make sure you switch the "owner" field from your personal Github account to the organization's Github account (Note: This requires you to already be a member of the organization!)

If you don't switch this field, you'll create a repository in your personal Github, which is fine, but not the goal of this guide ðŸ˜…

Finally, choose a name for your new repository under "Repository name". This will be the name of the folder in the organization's Github page. Also, consider changing the name of the local repository in the top field. This is the directory where your files will be locally stored on your workstation.

Hit _Create and Push_ to build the repository, and that should be it! You can check on the Organization's Github page to check that the repositoryn was built sucessfully.
